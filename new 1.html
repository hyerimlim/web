			<br>&bull; Dynamic walking: Although human walking is achieved by complicated control of multi-segmental & multi-actuated mechanism, the mechanics of the center of mass, the core of rigid body movement, appears to be a simple passive dynamics, which could be described by a response of mass-spring system. The passive dynamic walking approach, therefore, could serve as a theoretical framework to understand the mechanics of human walking. Due to the model simplicity, however, the current dynamic walking model explains only mechanics of center of mass. Thus, my research focuses on demonstrating 1) multi-joint movement of lower limb and 2) mechanics of bipedalism with spring mechanics and understanding mechanical dominance of human walking.</br>
			<br>&bull; Wearable motion monitoring system: Recent advances in micro sensors made it possible to outdoor motion capture and even monitor daily activity over a longer period. A number of sensors for reliable data collection should be compromised with the cost of the manufacturing and maintenance. With the knowledge of human movement biomechanics, we proposed a model-based hybrid wearable motion monitoring system, which estimated un-measured kinetic and kinematic data from measured motion and biomechanics model. Based on the mechanical constraints of lower limb motions and center of mass motions from the model, the joint kinematics and kinetics could be estimated from center of mass motion. Developing a model-hybrid algorithm and wearable system with IMU are under research.</br></div>
